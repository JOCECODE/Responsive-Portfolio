This project uses the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. I used bootstrap's navbar and cards components and the project has 3 html files (portfolio.html, index.html, contact.html) and 3 different css files.

There is an index.md for github compatibility.

The picture files are in a folder and these were obtained online.

This project features my portfolio of interests I would like to pursue with coding.

Index is the ABOUT page which is a small description of me.

Contact features a form that allows user to put there name, email, and message to be able to email me to my email address.
